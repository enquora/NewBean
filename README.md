#  Bean.app

Bean is a word processor, written in Cocoa. There is a newer version than this [at bean-osx.com](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html) which requires Mojave (10.14) or newer. This version, 2.4.5, is the latest open source release at time of writing: it is written to target the 10.4 APIs but the build was forward-ported to 10.15 by Graham Lee. The original source is by James Hoover.
